# Social Media Sentiment Tracker

The Social Media Sentiment Tracker is an AI-powered Python program that allows users to analyze and track the sentiment of a specific topic or keyword on various social media platforms in real-time. The program leverages libraries such as BeautifulSoup, requests, and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to gather data from social media platforms and perform sentiment analysis on the collected data.

## Features

1. **Social Media Data Collection:** The program uses web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup to extract data related to a specific keyword or topic from popular social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. It retrieves posts, comments, and messages that match the user's search criteria.

2. **Data Cleansing:** The program applies data cleansing techniques to remove noise, irrelevant content, and duplicate entries from the collected social media data. It utilizes NLTK for tasks such as tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and emoji handling to ensure accurate sentiment analysis.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:** The program performs sentiment analysis on the collected social media data using pre-trained machine learning models or lexicons. It leverages NLTK's sentiment analysis capabilities to classify each post or comment as positive, negative, or neutral, offering insights into the overall sentiment trend surrounding the chosen topic.

4. **Real-time Tracking and Visualization:** The program provides real-time monitoring and visualization of the sentiment trends surrounding the selected topic. It utilizes Matplotlib or other plotting libraries to generate interactive charts and graphs, allowing users to track the sentiment fluctuations over time.

5. **Keyword Customization and Filtering:** The program allows users to customize the search keywords and apply filters to refine the collected data. Users can specify additional criteria, such as language preferences, location, or date range, to focus on specific subsets of social media content.

6. **Automated Notifications:** The program can be configured to send automated notifications or alerts whenever a significant sentiment shift occurs or when specific predefined conditions are met. Users can receive notifications via email or instant messaging platforms.
